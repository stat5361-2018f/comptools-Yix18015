First commit
At first, I learnt how to install package in the gitHub. By using "devtools::install.github"
Then wile face "fail to compile the main.md file". at first I tried to install pandoc by using homebrew. The mac is already has the pandoc, so what i have to do is to update the pandoc. After update, paste '/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"' at a Terminal prompt. Then the homebre will automatically install. 
For PDF output, we also need to install LaTeX. So I install the full MaxTex. 
After that, I faced the error that lost fond in order to create PDF. So google the fond which is need, than install it.
